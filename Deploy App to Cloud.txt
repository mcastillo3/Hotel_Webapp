Opting for Microsoft Azure as my cloud service provider, I'd migrate my multithreaded Spring web application to the cloud.
Initially, I'd establish an Azure Container Registry to house my application's image.
Following that, I'd generate my image with a suitable version label, such as 'latest,' and transfer it to the registry.
Subsequently, I'd instantiate an Azure Container Instance, utilizing the image previously uploaded to the Azure Container Registry.
Lastly, I'd initiate the deployment of the Azure Container Instance to ensure its accessibility and online presence.
